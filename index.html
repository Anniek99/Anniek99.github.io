    <h1>Annie Katz — Hands-On Engineering Portfolio</h1>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <p class="intro">
      I build biomedical engineering projects based on real problems experienced by my family, my teammates, and myself.
      My work combines sensors, wearables, mechanical design, and embedded systems with the goal of creating practical
      devices that help people move, heal, or sense their bodies better.

    <h2>Individual Projects</h2>


    <!-- GI TRACKED -->
    <div class="project">
      <img src="images/gi-tracked.jpg" alt="GI Tracked system">

      <span class="tag">Wearables</span>
      <span class="tag">Biosignals</span>
      <span class="tag">Sensors</span>

      <h3>GI Tracked — Wearable Gut Rhythm Monitoring System</h3>

      <p>
        <b>Problem:</b> My own gut rhythms became irregular during a period of stress and injury recovery,
        and I realized there was no way to continuously monitor gastrointestinal activity during daily life.<br><br>

        <b>What I built:</b> A multi-sensor wearable system using contact microphones and thermistors placed
        strategically around the abdomen, designed to capture digestive sound cycles and temperature variation.
        I built a soft spandex+mesh waistband and a data logging module using a QT Py ESP32-S3.<br><br>

        <b>Challenges:</b> Reducing motion noise, designing comfortable long-wear placement, and tuning analog
        filtering for quiet biosignals.<br><br>

        <b>Impact:</b> This system may support early detection of motility disorders or general gut dysregulation —
        a long-term goal is correlating gut activity with circadian rhythm patterns.

    <!-- ULTRASOUND -->

      <img src="images/ultrasound.jpg" alt="DIY ultrasound project">

      <span class="tag">Imaging</span>
      <span class="tag">Rehabilitation</span>

      <h3>At-Home Muscle Ultrasound Probe</h3>

      <p>
        <b>Problem:</b> After tearing my hamstring twice, I couldn’t safely track healing without repeated clinic visits.
        I needed a way to visualize tissue recovery at home.<br><br>

        <b>What I built:</b> A low-cost ultrasound setup using a portable transducer, signal conditioning,
        and a mobile display pipeline to observe muscle thickness/texture changes over time.<br><br>

        <b>Challenges:</b> Interpreting noisy images and maintaining consistent probe angle during scans.<br><br>

        <b>Impact:</b> Home monitoring could help young athletes recover more safely while avoiding re-injury.
      </p>

    <!-- SCANDAGE -->

      <img src="images/scandage.jpg" alt="Scandage diagnostic tool">

      <span class="tag">Diagnostics</span>
      <span class="tag">AI-assisted</span>

      <h3>Scandage — Smart Screening Tool</h3>

      <p>
        <b>Problem:</b> Many conditions go undiagnosed for long periods because people lack easy at-home screening tools.<br><br>

        <b>What I built:</b> A small sensing device that captures signals and uses ML classification
        (prototype dataset) to give fast at-home screening feedback.<br><br>

        <b>Challenges:</b> Calibration drift and achieving consistent sensor contact.<br><br>

        <b>Impact:</b> Aims to reduce diagnostic delays through accessible pre-screening.

    <!-- GRIP HERO -->
    <div class="project">
      <img src="images/griphero.jpg" alt="Grip Hero v1">

      <span class="tag">Rehabilitation</span>
      <span class="tag">Motor Control</span>

      <h3>Grip Hero (v1)</h3>

      <p>
        <b>Problem:</b> My sister has dyspraxia and low hand tone, and existing grip exercisers were not engaging or adaptive.<br><br>

        <b>What I built:</b> A game-based grip trainer with a load cell, microcontroller, and visual feedback system.<br><br>

        <b>Challenges:</b> Inconsistent force readings and mechanical friction in the first sliding design.<br><br>

        <b>Impact:</b> Made grip therapy more fun and motivating for her.

    <!-- GRIPSTER (v2) -->
    <div class="project">
      <img src="images/gripster-demo.gif" alt="Gripster v2 demo">

      <span class="tag">Iteration</span>
      <span class="tag">Human-centered Design</span>

      <h3>Gripster (v2)</h3>

      <p>
        <b>Improvement Focus:</b> A smoother, lighter, more ergonomic version of the grip trainer.<br><br>

        <b>What changed:</b> I redesigned the rail system, repositioned the sensors, added better firmware filtering,
        and made the device easier for my sister to use independently.<br><br>

        <b>Learning:</b> How iteration transforms a “working prototype” into something that actually fits a user’s needs.

        <b>Problem:</b> My younger brother is extremely sensitive to sudden sounds, causing anxiety in daily settings.<br><br>

        <b>What I'm building:</b> A wearable sound-filtering device that detects triggers and softens them
        using targeted frequency dampening.<br><br>

        <b>Status:</b> Hardware prototype in progress.
